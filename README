I. WHAT IS THIS?

It's a stream wrapper implementing Gopher support in PHP.


II. UH, WHY?

Why not? I like Gopher.


III. NO, SERIOUSLY, WHY?

Well, I wrote a Gopher interface for Wordpress a while back and thought it'd be
nice if I could interact with it.


IV. OH, THAT MAKES COMPLETE... WAIT, A GOPHER INTERFACE TO WORDPRESS?!

Yep! You can get it at http://github.com/LawnGnome/wp-gopher.


V. OK THEN. WHAT DOES THIS REQUIRE?

PHP 5.3, since I've stopped caring about versions of PHP where I can't use
anonymous functions.


VI. HOW DO I USE IT?

There's a demo file called demo.php, but the short version is: include
GopherStream.php and open something with a Gopher URL. There's even opendir()
support, although it's kind of useless.

There's also quite a bit of inline documentation. You can run phpDocumentor
over GopherStream.php to extract it, if you like, although you probably don't
need to.


VII. SHOULDN'T THERE BE TESTS OR SOMETHING?

Probably, but I didn't feel like writing a mock Gopher server.


VIII. I HAVE A BUG REPORT/FEATURE SUGGESTION/SOME CRACK, SINCE YOU'RE CLEARLY
      ON DRUGS ANYWAY.

Lodge a report on GitHub and it will be dealt with appropriately.
